Anything in the scripts folder arent needed for the engine to run, they are simple scripts that I wrote for development purposes, although they are useful for testing the engine.
If you do delete the scripts folder, you will need to fix a few things in game.cs to suit your needs.

I tried to make the engine as simple as possible, so that anyone can use it, and not just me.
These scripts should show off some of the cool things you can do with the engine.

If you look in generation.cs you can see how I create a new gameobject and procedurally generate terrain using it, all I had to do was create an instance of the script in game.cs and call the function.
