Basically just made this to learn and for fun.
I dont know C++ so I settled for OpenTK because I really like C#.

I wrote pretty much all of this myself because I wanted to figure stuff out on my own (obviously used the documentation)

Im pretty proud of the mesh to mesh collision detection even if its really laggy and unoptimized, it still works.
I literally opened Unity to mess around with rays and figure out how to get triangle ray intersection to work.

I planned on adding aabb detection before it started actually checking collision, but I never got around to it so its just
doing sphere checks because they are really cheap to do.

Im also pretty proud of the obj loader. I know its not much, but I really liked the proccess of researching how an obj
file works and using that information to make an obj loader.
