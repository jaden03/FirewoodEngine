This is the first game made with the engine.

I just got collision detection back into the engine along with collision and trigger events that you can listen for and I
figured it was time to give the engine a spin.

Just a simple first person game where you can collect coins.
Firewood Engine has no sound or ui yet.

This is already sorta outdated as of October 20th 2022
